# PeakScout: A User-Friendly Tool for Mapping Genomic Peaks to Genes

## Introduction

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and similar techniques have revolutionized our understanding of protein-DNA interactions, chromatin modifications, and gene regulation. These experiments typically generate thousands of genomic regions of interest (peaks) that represent binding sites or enriched chromatin marks. However, translating these genomic coordinates into biologically meaningful insights remains challenging, particularly for researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise.

The critical step of associating genomic peaks with nearby genes is essential for understanding regulatory networks and interpreting experimental results. While several sophisticated tools exist for genomic data analysis, they often require significant computational skills, command-line proficiency, and parameter optimization. BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) offers comprehensive functionality for manipulating genomic intervals but demands familiarity with command-line operations and complex parameter settings. Other tools like HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010), GREAT (McLean et al., 2010), and ChIPseeker (Yu et al., 2015) provide peak annotation capabilities but either require programming knowledge or offer limited flexibility in defining proximity relationships.

PeakScout addresses this gap by providing a straightforward, accessible solution for bidirectional mapping between genomic peaks and genes. Unlike existing tools that may overwhelm users with complex options or require extensive bioinformatics training, PeakScout offers an intuitive approach that accepts standard output from popular peak callers (MACS2, SEACR) and produces researcher-friendly results in familiar formats (CSV, Excel). The tool supports both peak-to-gene and gene-to-peak analyses, allowing researchers to either identify potential target genes of regulatory elements or find regulatory elements that might influence specific genes of interest.

By simplifying this critical analytical step, PeakScout enables bench scientists and bioinformatics novices to quickly interpret their genomic data without extensive computational training. The tool's straightforward implementation and accessible output formats facilitate rapid integration with downstream analyses and visualization tools, accelerating the path from raw peak data to biological insights.
