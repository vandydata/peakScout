## Installation

Steps from github install

## Usage

Couple of basic commands

## Notes

Genomes to target: mm10, mm39, hg19, hg38

Get annotations from Gencode, i.e. M25 for mm10 (which is aka GRCm38)

From gencode files, we can get chr, start, end, feature name, feature type (`gene`, `transcript`, etc), and biotype (eg. `gene_type "TEC";`)

Write a parser for the GTF data and at least get it into the lowest common denominator currently need, optimizations can come later
